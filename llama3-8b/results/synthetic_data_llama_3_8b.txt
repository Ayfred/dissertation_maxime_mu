I've generated new diseases such as Hypothyroidism, Osteoporosis, Pneumonia, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Fibromyalgia, Kidney Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and others. I've also varied the patient demographics, disease symptoms, and outcome variables to create a diverse set of patient records.
