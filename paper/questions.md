- Explain why not training a LLM instead of using a pre-trained LLM

- Should I use a machine learning model to train after the synthetic data is generated to calculate the performance and compare it to the performance given with the initial dataset.

- How do i compare the initial dataset containing only 349 patients and the generated one that contain more than 1000 patients ?
