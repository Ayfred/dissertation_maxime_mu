\end{figure}

From figure \ref{fig:age_distrib}, the density curve \ref{fig:age_ctgan} shows that the CTGAN model can capture the dominant patient age demographic. Nonetheless, there is a slight variation compared to the original data.
The density curves, from \ref{fig:age_begreat}, indicate an almost perfect alignment between the generated data and the original data, showcasing the model's effectiveness in replicating the age distribution. The density curve from the LLaMa-3 model (\ref{fig:age_llama}) shows a very close alignment with the original data, but it is still better compared to the CTGAN and not as precise as the BeGreat model.

Figure \ref{fig:disease_distrib} illustrates the disease distribution from the original and synthetic data. CTGAN (\ref{fig:disease_ctgan}) as well as BeGreat (\ref{fig:disease_begreat}) replicate almost identical to the original data. However, LLaMa-3 (\ref{fig:disease_llama}) suggests a more different and diverse range of diseases with a high density for the miscellaneous category. LLaMa-3 was given a prompt where was asked the model to generate new diseases, which is why there is a higher density in the miscellaneous category.

Figure \ref{fig:dim_means_distrib} shows different scatter plots of the dimensionwise means with 95\% confidence intervals. The CTGAN model (\ref{fig:avg_dim_ctgan}) shows a correlation coefficient of 0.814, demonstrating that the model can synthesize correlated data to the original data with a high concentration of points in the lower values. However, the BeGreat model (\ref{fig:avg_dim_begreat}) has a correlation value of 1.036 which shows a perfect correlation between the synthetic and original data. This strong correlation can also be seen in the distribution \ref{fig:age_begreat}. LLaMa-3 has a correlation coefficient of 0.929 (\ref{fig:avg_dim_llama}), indicating that the model could capture the complex distribution of the original data.

\subsection{Classification Accuracy Test Results}

The generated data consists of only 348 individual records, which is considered very low for training and evaluating machine learning models. A small training sample can lead to inaccuracies and biased outcomes. 


\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
        \centering

        \label{fig:dataset1_ml}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:dataset1_ml} shows the performance of different machine learning models using the first dataset. The decision tree, random forest classifiers and the logistic regression all show high accuracies. This is highly due to the fact that the model has been trained on a small sample and cannot give consistent and accurate results. However, the AdaBoost classifier was able to capture the difference lying in the different generated data. LLaMa-3 is outperforming both BeGreat and CTGAN and demonstrates the highest overall accuracies. The same goes for the BeGreat model it was able to perform better than CTGAN.



\subsection{Privacy Metrics Comparison}

For better visualization, the results of the data privacy metrics are normalized. 


\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/dataset1_privacy.png}
        \caption{Comparison of normalised privacy metrics for synthetic data models in the first dataset.}
        \label{fig:dataset1_privacy}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:dataset1_privacy} shows various privacy metrics results of the different models.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Nearest Neighbour Distance Ratio \\
    All models show very close values to 1.0. However, a high value of the neatest neighbour distance ratio indicates a low privacy. Digging into the precise values of the metric, which can be found in the appendix, the BeGreat suggests a lower value compared to the other two models. Nonetheless, data privacy is not respected for all models for that particular metric.

    \item[(b)] Median Distance to Closest Record \\
    CTGAN shows the highest median distance to the closest record, indicating the best privacy. Model BeGreat follows after the CTGAN model, while Model Llama3 has an infinite median distance, suggesting perfect privacy. % need to be checked

    
    \item[(c)] Hitting Rate \\
    LLaMa-3 suggests a higher hitting rate (0.0172), indicating slightly low privacy. BeGreat and CTGAN show the lowest hitting rate (0.0144), indicating better privacy. However, all hitting rates are close to the value 0 which in that case the normalization is not suited for this metric. Thus, all models contribute to better data privacy.


    \item[(d)] Epsilon Identifiability Risk \\
    LLaMa-3 shows the lowest epsilon identifiability risk (0.0805), followed by CTGAN (0.3381). BeGreat has the highest risk (0.3849). CTGAN and BeGreat have almost the same risk value, which suggests lower privacy. On the other hand, LLaMa-3 has a value much closer to 0, indicating that it performs better at generating data with a low risk of exposing real information. 

    \item[(e)] Attribute Disclosure Risk \\
    CTGAN shows the lowest attribute disclosure risk (0.7993), followed closely by BeGreat (0.8044). Llama3 has the highest risk (0.8540), indicating lower privacy. However, all models have a relatively high value of the attribute disclosure risk, which suggests they are as vulnerable as the others. %% better reformulation

Figure \ref{fig:dim_means_distrib_2} shows the mean-difference plots for different models. LLaMa-3 (\ref{fig:avg_dim_2_llama}) shows a drastic shift of the 'AGE' from the zero difference line (black vertical bar) showing that the model tends to generate more variability for the patient's age compared with the original data. On the other hand, the BeGreat model (\ref{fig:avg_dim_2_begreat}) shows a much closer 'AGE' variability from the original data. 
The BeGreat model shows relatively close values from the zero difference line for the other variables indicating that these variables are closer to the real data's variables. Conversely, the CTGAN and the LLaMa-3 model both depict more varied mean differences of variables such as MCV, ERYTHROCYTE etc... leading to more distinct data than the original data.

\end{tabularx}
\end{table}



From Table \ref{tab:avg_means_diff_combined}, we can analyze the performance of each model across both data sets:

\textbf{BeGreat} has the smallest mean difference in both data sets, indicating it most accurately replicates the average values of the original data.
\textbf{CTGAN} follows closely, showing slightly higher average means differences but still demonstrating good accuracy.
\textbf{Llama3} has the largest mean difference in both data sets but still maintains a reasonable level of accuracy.

\end{table}


From Table \ref{tab:attr_disclosure_risk_combined}, we can analyze the attribute disclosure risk for each model:

For the first dataset, CTGAN shows the lowest attribute disclosure risk (0.7993 Â± 0.0565), followed closely by BeGreat (0.8044 Â± 0.0540). Llama3 has the highest risk (0.8540 Â± 0.0472), indicating lower privacy.
For the second dataset, BeGreat shows the lowest attribute disclosure risk (0.1498 Â± 0.0666), indicating the best privacy. CTGAN follows with a risk of 0.2041 Â± 0.0459, while Llama3 has the highest risk (0.3977 Â± 0.1057), suggesting lower privacy.



\subsection{Summary of Findings}

The privacy metrics reveal that:

BeGreat generally provides the best privacy across most metrics in the second dataset, with the lowest epsilon identifiability risk and attribute disclosure risk.
CTGAN shows moderate privacy in the second dataset, with higher epsilon identifiability risk and attribute disclosure risk. However, in the first dataset, CTGAN performs better, especially in epsilon identifiability and attribute disclosure risks.
Llama3 exhibits good performance in some metrics like nearest neighbour distance ratio in the second dataset but has higher attribute disclosure risk, indicating it may be less reliable for privacy-sensitive applications. In the first dataset, Llama3 shows lower performance in privacy metrics.

\subsection{Conclusion}

These findings highlight the privacy strengths and weaknesses of each model. The BeGreat model is recommended for applications where privacy is a critical concern, especially in the second dataset. The CTGAN model offers moderate privacy protections in the second dataset but performs better in the first dataset. The Llama3 model may require further improvements to ensure sufficient privacy protections in synthetic data.

\section{Comparative Analysis of Original and Synthetic Data}

\subsection{Dimensionwise Means Difference}

The dimensionwise means difference metric measures how closely the synthetic data matches the mean values of the original data for each dimension, with 95\% confidence intervals.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/begeat_dimension.png}
    \caption{Dimensionwise Means Difference for BeGreat Model}
    \label{fig:begreat_means_diff}
\end{figure}

From Figure \ref{fig:begreat_means_diff}, Model BeGreat shows small mean differences for most dimensions, with the largest difference observed in AGE. The overall pattern indicates a close match to the original data for most dimensions, suggesting good accuracy in replicating the original data's means.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/ctgan_dimension.png}
    \caption{Dimensionwise Means Difference for CTGAN Model}
    \label{fig:ctgan_means_diff}
\end{figure}

From Figure \ref{fig:ctgan_means_diff}, Model CTGAN shows small mean differences for most dimensions, but with slightly larger differences in dimensions like AGE and MCV. The overall pattern indicates a reasonable match to the original data for most dimensions, though not as close as BeGreat.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/llama_dimension.png}
    \caption{Dimensionwise Means Difference for Llama3 Model}
    \label{fig:llama3_means_diff}
\end{figure}

From Figure \ref{fig:llama3_means_diff}, Model Llama3 shows larger mean differences for several dimensions, particularly AGE, indicating a less accurate replication of the original data's means compared to BeGreat and CTGAN. However, it still demonstrates a reasonable level of accuracy for some dimensions.

\subsection{Summary of Findings}

The dimensionwise means difference plots reveal that:
- **BeGreat** shows the smallest mean differences for most dimensions, indicating the best overall performance in replicating the original data's means.
- **CTGAN** performs reasonably well but shows slightly larger differences in some dimensions compared to BeGreat.
- **Llama3** exhibits larger mean differences for several dimensions, particularly AGE, indicating a lower accuracy in replicating the original data's means.

\subsection{Conclusion}

These findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each model in terms of dimensionwise means difference. The BeGreat model is recommended for applications requiring high fidelity in replicating the original data's means, while the CTGAN model offers a balanced performance. The Llama3 model may require further refinement to improve accuracy in replicating the original data's means.
